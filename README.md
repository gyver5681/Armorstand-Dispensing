# Armorstand Dispensing Parity Fix

In Java, Armorstands are dispensed as full-size entities. This Addon attempts to bring parity to Bedrock by replacing dispensed armorstand items with an armorstand entity.

## Caveat:

The velocity bounds checking in use is still resulting in an occasional false-negative, resulting in an occasional armorstand item being dispensed instead of an entity. I'm open to suggestions.

## ToDo:
* Create a pack icon.
* Package up an actual addon.
